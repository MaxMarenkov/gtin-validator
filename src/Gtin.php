 * A GTIN is a string of digits that uniquely identifies a trade item (a product that is bought and sold). A GTIN is
 * globally unique, meaning that no two products in the world share the same GTIN. There is a GS1 Standard
 * called the "GTIN Allocation Rules" which helps to ensure this. For example, the GTIN Allocation Rules specify that
 * if the same product is available in two different sizes, such as a one-liter bottle of soft drink and a two-liter
 * bottle of the same soft drink, these are considered different products and so must have different GTINs. Two
 * instances of the same product will have the same GTIN; for example, all one-liter bottles of the same soft drink
 * will carry the same GTIN.

    /**
     * A GTIN can consist of 12, 13, 14, or 8 digits.
     * The reason for different lengths is mostly historical:
     *
     * The original GTIN, introduced in the year 1973, was 12 digits long. At the time, it was called the
     * Universal Product Code (UPC). Today, it is officially called GTIN-12, although the UPC name is still used.
     *
     * When use of the GTIN was expanded beyond the US the GTIN-13 was introduced. Originally, the
     * GTIN-13 was only used outside the US and Canada; today, the GTIN-13 may be used anywhere in the
     * world although in the US and Canada the GTIN-12 is still much more common.
     *
     * The GTIN-12 and GTIN-13 are used on trade items sold to consumers at point-of-sale terminals. When
     * the use of GTIN was expanded to non-consumer sale units, such as cases and pallets which are traded
     * in the supply chain but not sold to consumers in that form, the GTIN-14 was introduced. GTIN-14 may
     * not be used on trade items sold to consumers at point-of-sale. GTIN-14s are typically used to identify
     * cases, pallets, and other similar non-consumer logistic units (but a case or pallet could also be
     * identified by a GTIN-12 or GTIN-13 instead of a GTIN-14).
     *
     * The GTIN-8 was introduced to allow for a smaller bar code to fit on small consumer-sale packages that
     * could not easily accommodate the full GTIN-12 or GTIN-13.
